  abstract = {Measuring motion of the human foot presents a unique challenge due to the large number of closely packed bones with congruent articulating surfaces. Optical motion capture (OMC) and multi-segment models can be used to infer foot motion, but might be affected by soft tissue artifact (STA). Biplanar videoradiography (BVR) is a relatively new tool that allows direct, non-invasive measurement of bone motion using high-speed, dynamic x-ray images to track individual bones. It is unknown whether OMC and BVR can be used interchangeably to analyse multi-segment foot motion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the agreement in kinematic measures of dynamic activities. Nine healthy participants performed three walking and three running trials while BVR was recorded with synchronous OMC. Bone position and orientation was determined through manual scientific-rotoscoping. The OMC and BVR kinematics were co-registered to the same coordinate system, and BVR tracking was used to create virtual markers for comparison to OMC during dynamic trials. Root mean square (RMS) differences in marker positions and joint angles as well as a linear fit method (LFM) was used to compare the outputs of both methods. When comparing BVR and OMC, sagittal plane angles were in good agreement (ankle: R2 = 0.947, 0.939; Medial Longitudinal Arch (MLA) Angle: R2 = 0.713, 0.703, walking and running, respectively). When examining the ankle, there was a moderate agreement between the systems in the frontal plane (R2 = 0.322, 0.452, walking and running, respectively), with a weak to moderate correlation for the transverse plane (R2 = 0.178, 0.326, walking and running, respectively). However, root mean squared error (RMSE) showed angular errors ranging from 1.06 to 8.31° across the planes (frontal: 3.57°, 3.67°, transverse: 4.28°, 4.70°, sagittal: 2.45°, 2.67°, walking and running, respectively). Root mean square (RMS) differences between OMC and BVR marker trajectories were task dependent with the largest differences in the shank (6.0 ± 2.01 mm) for running, and metatarsals (3.97 ± 0.81 mm) for walking. Based on the results, we suggest BVR and OMC provide comparable solutions to foot motion in the sagittal plane, however, interpretations of out-of-plane movement should be made carefully.},

  abstract = {The use of biplanar videoradiography technology has become increasingly popular for evaluating joint function in vivo. Two fundamentally different methods are currently employed to reconstruct 3D bone motions captured using this technology. Marker-based tracking requires at least three radio-opaque markers to be implanted in the bone of interest. Markerless tracking makes use of algorithms designed to match 3D bone shapes to biplanar videoradiography data. In order to reliably quantify in vivo bone motion, the systematic error of these tracking techniques should be evaluated. Herein, we present new markerless tracking software that makes use of modern GPU technology, describe a versatile method for quantifying the systematic error of a biplanar videoradiography motion capture system using independent gold standard instrumentation, and evaluate the systematic error of the W.M. Keck XROMM Facility's biplanar videoradiography system using both marker-based and markerless tracking algorithms under static and dynamic motion conditions. A polycarbonate flag embedded with 12 radio-opaque markers was used to evaluate the systematic error of the marker-based tracking algorithm. Three human cadaveric bones (distal femur, distal radius, and distal ulna) were used to evaluate the systematic error of the markerless tracking algorithm. The systematic error was evaluated by comparing motions to independent gold standard instrumentation. Static motions were compared to high accuracy linear and rotary stages while dynamic motions were compared to a high accuracy angular displacement transducer. Marker-based tracking was shown to effectively track motion to within 0.1\,mm and 0.1 deg under static and dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the presented results indicate that markerless tracking can be used to effectively track rapid bone motions to within 0.15 deg for the distal aspects of the femur, radius, and ulna. Both marker-based and markerless tracking techniques were in excellent agreement with the gold standard instrumentation for both static and dynamic testing protocols. Future research will employ these techniques to quantify in vivo joint motion for high-speed upper and lower extremity impacts such as jumping, landing, and hammering.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapists, as clinical human movement experts, must qualitatively evaluate patients' functional and biomechanical impairments. There are now low-cost 2- and 3-dimensional video measurement systems that can be used to increase the precision and reliability of these qualitative clinical assessments. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review current low-cost video-based methods for motion analysis compared with gold-standard 3-dimensional biomechanical methods. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches were conducted until January 2018 within the following databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, Scopus, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. STUDY SELECTION: Studies designed to evaluate criterion-referenced validity and/or reliability of video-based motion analysis technologies within the last 20~years were included. English-language articles dealing with human rehabilitation were considered. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was independently completed by 3 reviewers, and methodological quality was assessed using the 2018 Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. Articles were organized for analysis on the basis of type of motion analyzed and category of each low-cost technology used. DATA SYNTHESIS: With 20 articles meeting selection criteria, 10 low-cost motion analysis platforms were presented, each examining different functional movement-dependent variables. Overall article quality was "low" or "very low" on the basis of Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments scoring. Correlations between low-cost and 3-dimensional gold standard systems ranged widely from "poor" agreement (r~=~0.025) to "strong" agreement (r~=~0.992). Spatiotemporal gait parameters consistently outperformed planar joint angle data. Reliability was better measured than concurrent validity. A summary table was developed to assist clinicians in choosing which motions could potentially be measured accurately by each low-cost platform on the basis of current findings. LIMITATIONS: Databases available to researchers were more clinical/medical in nature, and this review was written from that clinically based perspective. Lack of standardized protocols and methodology within included studies was common, making generalizability difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Research attempting to validate newer low-cost movement analysis systems is limited in quality. Measurement of only certain variables should be considered when these tools are used. Further research is warranted, because these devices still have potential clinical utility for supplementing qualitative movement assessment with objective outcome measures.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of 3D motion capture in both sports and clinical research settings is largely dependent on the reliability of the obtained measurements. This study aimed to determine whether there are 3D kinematic differences both between and within researchers with three different levels of familiarity in 3D marker placement. Fifteen male participants ran across a 22 m laboratory at 4.0 m.s(-1). Three researchers (experienced, intermediate and novice) positioned lower extremity markers on two occasions. Differences in 3D joint kinetics/kinematics both between and within researchers were examined using mixed ANOVA's. The within researcher reliability of the kinetic/kinematic waveforms were further analysed using intraclass correlations. The results show that significant differences in discrete parameters were observed in the transverse plane between researchers and also in the coronal and transverse planes within researcher for the novice practitioner. Furthermore, the results also showed that the experienced researcher was associated with the highest levels of reliability in marker placement. This suggests that it may be prudent for 3D analyses, in particular those with a clinical component to be conducted using experienced practitioners and for analyses to state the experience level of the researchers conducting the anatomical marker placement.},

  abstract = {Background Markerless motion capture has the potential to perform movement analysis with reduced data collection and processing time compared to marker-based methods. This technology is now starting to be applied for clinical and rehabilitation applications and therefore it is crucial that users of these systems understand both their potential and limitations. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of markerless motion capture for both single camera and multi-camera systems. Additionally, this review explores how practical applications of markerless technology are being used in clinical and rehabilitation settings, and examines the future challenges and directions markerless research must explore to facilitate full integration of this technology within clinical biomechanics. Methodology A scoping review is needed to examine this emerging broad body of literature and determine where gaps in knowledge exist, this is key to developing motion capture methods that are cost effective and practically relevant to clinicians, coaches and researchers around the world. Literature searches were performed to examine studies that report accuracy of markerless motion capture methods, explore current practical applications of markerless motion capture methods in clinical biomechanics and identify gaps in our knowledge that are relevant to future developments in this area. Results Markerless methods increase motion capture data versatility, enabling datasets to be re-analyzed using updated pose estimation algorithms and may even provide clinicians with the capability to collect data while patients are wearing normal clothing. While markerless temporospatial measures generally appear to be equivalent to marker-based motion capture, joint center locations and joint angles are not yet sufficiently accurate for clinical applications. Pose estimation algorithms are approaching similar error rates of marker-based motion capture, however, without comparison to a gold standard, such as bi-planar videoradiography, the true accuracy of markerless systems remains unknown. Conclusions Current open-source pose estimation algorithms were never designed for biomechanical applications, therefore, datasets on which they have been trained are inconsistently and inaccurately labelled. Improvements to labelling of open-source training data, as well as assessment of markerless accuracy against gold standard methods will be vital next steps in the development of this technology.},
