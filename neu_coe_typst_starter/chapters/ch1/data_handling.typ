== Handling Motion Capture Data
A key part of the analysis pipelines used for the following studies involved needing a way to manage human motion data coming from a variety of sources. For the most part, the data in our pipeline exists as a 3D point cloud. However, when it comes to analyses such as center-of-mass calculation or joint angle calculation, or even visualizing the data, it becomes necessary to acknowledge that the data does indeed have a specific shape. For example, in chapters 2 and 3 (???) we examine 2D data reconstructed using different pose estimation backends, which each track different keypoints. In chapter 4 (???) we look at reconstructing data from a custom-trained model - in this case of a prosthetic leg - but also laying the ground work for a pipeline where a user can train a model to track anything they want. 

In the process of collecting and analyzing this data, and in looking forward to where the software is moving, it became necessary to look at how we could gracefully handle a myriad of inputs to our reconstruction software. This led to the development of `skellymodels`, a respository for loading, manipulating, and saving out 3D motion capture data from any source. The repository consists of different data classes, ranging from strongly typed (such as the `Human`, a class with strictly defined options for loading body, hands and face data) to flexible (such as the `Object` class, a class with just one set of motion capture data that can be tailored towards custom-tracking models). User-defined YAMLs are used to create the definitions of the specific models themselves - which allows for the eventually integration of user-defined custom models, while also allowing for a more defined path for outside users to contribute new pose estimation software to our pipeline. 

A key part of `skellymodels` is that it is also made to make the manipulation of motion capture for biomechanical analyses more convenient. The models provide easy ways to load in FreeMoCap `npy` and `csv` files. Biomechanical analyses such as center-of-mass and rigid body calculations are linked to the model. Making it easy to add more or other things.
