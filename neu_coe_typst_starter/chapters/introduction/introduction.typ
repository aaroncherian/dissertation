== Introduction
In writing the chapters of this dissertation, there is a common theme I noticed that seems apt to name at the start: the ability to obtain quantitative kinematic data would benefit a great many fields, but the tools that would allow this to be done at a widespread scale remain out of reach of many practitioners. The following chapters span the development and validation of one potential solution to make motion analysis accessible to all. 


== Quantitative Motion Analysis

Human movement is an adaptive, complex mechanism. Quantitative motion analysis looks to find measurable terms from this complexity (i.e. joint angles, acceleration profiles) so that they can be studied and interpreted. While at a glance, this research may seem to belong chiefly to the domain of researchers and clinicians, methods of quantitative movement analysis are embedded in daily living. Smartphones and wearable health devices routinely measure and present motion data in user-friendly and interpretable ways. Users may use the information given to them (e.g. step count, daily fitness level) in a variety of ways, including informal feedback for the curious user or as a more serious indicator in trends of health and mobility (particularly when combined with sensors EKG or pulse ox sensors often integrated into wearable smart devices). We can consider quantitative motion analysis at a clinical level to have a similar level of impact.  Highly detailed quantitative motion analysis can also be used across a spectrum of biomechanical research. [insert some sentences about biomechanics/walking, pathology, rehabilitation and all that.]

== Marker-based motion capture
Marker-based motion capture systems reconstruct three-dimensional joint positions by tracking reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks using multiple calibrated cameras. These systems have found use across a multitude of domains: clinical gait analyses and diagnosis and treatment of rehabilitation in healthcare, film and animation in the entertainment industry, and across robotics as well@menolottoMotionCaptureTechnology2020. Marker-based motion capture is highly accurate and tends to be considered a gold-standard for comparison against other motion analysis techniques@colyerReviewEvolutionVisionBased2018. However, these systems have limitations of their own. Exact placement of markers on anatomical landmarks requires training and the experience level of the researcher can impact the reliability and accuracy of marker placement @sinclairInfluenceTesterExperience2014. Marker-based motion capture systems are prone to soft tissue artifacts - where the movement of skin relative to bone introduces error into marker trajectories and subsequent kinematic tracking@camomillaHumanMovementAnalysis2017. From an infrastructure standpoint, marker-based motion capture systems are expensive, require specalized hardware and space, require skilled users to operate and clean the data @parksCurrentLowCostVideoBased2019, which limits adoption in clinical spaces@buckleyRoleMovementAnalysis2019.


Marker-placement may not be appropriate for certain patient populations, and the placement of markers on their own have been shown to alter natural behavior (CITATION). 

== Biplanar videoradiography 
It should be noted that while marker-based motion capture will be referred to through this work as the 'gold-standard', one of the most accurate methods of measuring and evaluating joint function to date is biplanar videoradiography. Biplanar videography is a method of mapping the pose of 3D bone models using synchronized x-ray image sequences of motions @kesslerDirectComparisonBiplanar2019 with sub-millimeter accuracy. One study by Miranda et al. finding joint tracking errors ranging from .25-.30mm for the foot @mirandaStaticDynamicError2011. Despite high accuracy, cost, lack of whole-body kinematics and complicated setup make biplanar videoradiography impractical for widespread adoption @wadeApplicationsLimitationsCurrent2022. 

== Mention of clinical measures of mvoement?

== Accelerometers
Accelerometers are sensors that can detect a variety of accelration changes, including those due to gravity (constant acceleration), vibration (time-varying acceleration) or tilt (quasi-static acceleration)@mohammedMonolithicMultiDegree2018. Accelerometers, with the development and widespread use of smartphones, have become nearly ubiquitous. Several studies have found reliability and success in using smartphone accelerometers for gait analysis@grouiosAccelerometersOurPocket2022@nishiguchiReliabilityValidityGait2012.
