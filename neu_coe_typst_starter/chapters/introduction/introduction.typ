== Introduction
Across the chapters of this dissertation, a consistent theme emerges: the ability to obtain kinematic data using quantitative motion analysis would benefit a great many fields, but the tools that would allow this remain out of reach of many practitioners. The following work is about examining the capabilities and limitations of one potential method to make quantitative motion analysis accessible to all. 

== Quantitative Motion Analysis

Human movement is an adaptive, complex mechanism. Quantitative motion analysis looks to find measurable terms from this complexity (i.e. joint angles, acceleration profiles) so that they can be studied and interpreted. Methods of quantitative movement analysis are embedded in daily life. Smartphones and wearable health devices routinely measure and translate motion in user-friendly and interpretable ways, such as step count or daily activity level. Such data can be used in a variety of ways: as informal feedback for a curious user, an indicator of trends in health and mobility, and with certain devices can be combined with other sensors (EMG, pulse ox) to give a more general sense of wellness. In a similar vein, at a clinical or research level, highly detailed quantitative motion analysis can also be used across a spectrum of biomechanical research. [insert some sentences about biomechanics/walking, pathology, rehabilitation and all that.]

== Biplanar videoradiography 
To date, one of the most accurate methods of measuring and evaluating joint function is biplanar videoradiography, a method of mapping the pose of 3D bone models using syncrhonized x-ray image sequences of motions @kesslerDirectComparisonBiplanar2019 with sub-millimeter accuracy. One study by Miranda et al. finding joint tracking errors ranging from .25-.30mm for the foot @mirandaStaticDynamicError2011. Despite high accuracy, cost, lack of whole-body kinematics and complicated setup make biplanar videoradiography impractical for widespread adoption @wadeApplicationsLimitationsCurrent2022. For this reason, marker-based motion capture systems are often considered a 'gold-standard' reference in the motion analysis field, and will be referred to as such throughout this work. 

== Marker-based motion capture
Marker-based motion capture systems reconstruct three-dimensional joint positions by tracking reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks using multiple calibrated cameras. These systems have found use across a multitude of domains: clinical gait analyses and diagnosis and treatment of rehabilitation in healthcare, film and animation in the entertainment industry, and across robotics as well@menolottoMotionCaptureTechnology2020. Marker-based motion capture is highly accurate and tends to be considered a gold-standard for comparison against other motion analysis techniques@colyerReviewEvolutionVisionBased2018. However, these systems have limitations of their own. Exact placement of markers on anatomical landmarks requires training and the experience level of the researcher can impact the reliability and accuracy of marker placement @sinclairInfluenceTesterExperience2014. Marker-based motion capture systems are prone to soft tissue artifacts - where the movement of skin relative to bone introduces error into marker trajectories and subsequent kinematic tracking@camomillaHumanMovementAnalysis2017. From an infrastructure standpoint, marker-based motion capture systems are expensive, require specalized hardware and space, require skilled users to operate and clean the data @parksCurrentLowCostVideoBased2019. Marker-placement may not be appropriate for certain patient populations, and the placement of markers on their own have been shown to alter natural behavior. This has in part, lead to the development and testing of markerless motion capture systems.
