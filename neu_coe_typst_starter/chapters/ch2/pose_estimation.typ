== Pose Estimation
Pose estimation is the process of identifying 2D pixel coordinates of specific keypoints within an image. Human pose estimation models aim to find the joint center positions. This is a core part of any markerless motion capture software. OpenCap uses OpenPose, Theia Markerless uses a proprietary dataset. On our part, our default pose estimation is MediaPipe, an open-source software from Google. MediaPipe is easy to install, fast, and works without a CPU. This both makes it easy to include in package installation, and also allows even users without high-end computers to make use of our software. However, many pose estimation software exist, and in the biomechanics space, many have been acknowledged to be more accurate than MediaPipe. 

As such, and given the rapid pace of advancement in the computer vision field, it became clear that for FreeMoCap to be a software that could adapt to user and research needs, it could not be dependant on or limited to just on pose estimation software. It became necessary to format FreeMoCap as a 'framework' that could be extended to wrap around other pose estimation software. From a software standpoint, this presents a bit of a challenge. It means that no part of our software could be fully dependent on MediaPipe, and in fact needs to be fully generic and to the extent possible, agnostic to the specific pose estimation tracker being used. From a user standpoint, this also requires considerations. A core problem with many computer vision models released is that they are inaccessible to much of the public - a problem that we wanted to solve. FreeMoCap makes use of our repository `skellytracker` to handle the pose estimation. Much work has gone into making a generic form of this software that can adapt to the many nuances and quirks that come from different pose estimation software. Thus far, multiple pose estimation software beyond MediaPipe have been added to the software, including RTMPose and VITPose. 

However, done successfully, this model of adding new pose estimation trackers presents a unique way for users to make contributions that bring even more pose estimation software options into the framework of FreeMoCap - and eventually, could facilitate bringing the use of novel pose estimation software into public use much quicker.
